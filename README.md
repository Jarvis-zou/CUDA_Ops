# CUDA Operators Reproduction and Optimization

## Introduction

This project aims to reproduce and optimize various operators used in deep learning using CUDA. The goal is to leverage the parallel computing power of GPUs to enhance the performance of these operators, which are fundamental components in many deep learning models.

## Features

- **Operator Reproduction**: Implementations of commonly used deep learning operators such as matrix multiplication, convolution, activation functions, etc.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Application of CUDA-specific optimization techniques such as memory management, stream parallelism, and kernel fusion to improve the performance of these operators.
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Comparison of performance metrics between CPU and GPU implementations of the operators.

## Prerequisites

- **CUDA Toolkit**: Ensure that the CUDA toolkit is installed on your system. You can download it from [NVIDIA's official website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
- **NVIDIA GPU**: A CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU is required to run the CUDA code.
- **CLion IDE**: Recommended for development and debugging. You can download it from [JetBrains' official website](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
